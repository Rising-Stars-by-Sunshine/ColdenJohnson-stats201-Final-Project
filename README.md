- **Project Summary**:

As one of the largest social media platforms, Twitter can be used as one barometer of public sentiment (Ramteke et al., 2016). In this project, I explore the impact of Trump's actions on Twitter discourse through sentiment analysis and topic modeling using machine learning. Twitter data containing the keyword 'Trump' was queried between the years of 2020 and 2022. The data was preprocessed before applying supervised machine learning sentiment analysis, including the ROBERTA sentiment analysis AI (Poth et al., 2021). All Tweets were classified into one of three categories, 'positive', 'negative', and 'neutral' (Fig. 1). Results were visualized as timeseries data by grouping average tweet sentiment by day and hour (Fig. 4). Linear regression was also used to identify 2 major events of interest during this time period (fig. 5) Causal inference machine learning techniques were employed to find a strong causal effect from specified events (including Trump's actions during the capitol riots on Jan. 6 and Trump's Jan. 20 Concession Speech). However, due to the complex nature of events and limited dimensionality of the data, this machine-learning technique has limited effectiveness in the face of confounding variables. In general, Twitter sentiment reached its lowest point during the capitol attack, and thereafter climbed to its absolute maximum when Trump conceded defeat in the election. This affirms the view that Trump's actions during this time period were widely disapproved of by the American public, especially concerning his refusal to leave office.

I also identified several common topic clusters during the studied timeframe by applying unsupervised machine-learning techniques including topic modeling. Common topics of discourse can be grouped into three categories: discussion about the implications of the election, debate over vote validity, and Tweets broadly referencing the 'wants' and 'needs' of the American people. This research helps contribute to understanding how Donald Trump's actions were perceived by the American public, providing a more complete picture of events across the time period. It is also worth noting that Trump's Twitter ban had little impact on Tweet volume, topic, or sentiment, and did little to discourage discussion on the platform. This has implications when attempting to understand the limited impact of social media bans on public discourse. In the future, the research scope can be expanded to include a variety of public figures, in order to create a more generalizable predictive model for how Twitter discourse takes shape.

### Figures

![Sentiment_PieChart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118926209/223123994-7ef301c9-92d5-48d8-9b26-760f778fef38.png)

**Fig. 1**: Piechart showing sentiment distribution over the entire queried timespan. Tweet sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, with less than 6% being labeled as positive. This is not necessarily surprising, as negativity has been shown to be more common on Twitter than positive Tweets. However, negative Tweets are on average only about 15% more prevalent than positive (Goldenberg et. al). Therefore, this result shows a substantially more negative public opinion than would usually be expected in sentiment analysis of this type.

**Fig. 2**: Tweet volume of reply counts and retweet accounts, grouped by day. These two metrics closely track each other on both high and low days. The green vertical line indicates the date of the capitol riots, where there was a spike in activity. This activity remains elevated for the next several days, and another retweet spike can be seen on the day Trump's account was banned.

**Fig. 3**: Tweet volume over time. Tweet volume spikes during the capitol riots (Jan. 6) and remains elevated for several days.

**Fig. 4**: Average tweet sentiment over time visualized in a stacked line chart. The lowest sustained negative opinion (indicating a substantial trend) can be seen on the 3-day period surrounding Jan. 6, and the all-time high public opinion appears on Jan. 20 (Trump's concession speech).

**Fig. 5**: Graphed visualization of average Tweet sentiment over time, on a scale from -1.0 to +1.0. The first two vertical lines (local min and local max) mark the passage of a covid relief package through Congress. The sentiment around these two lines correctly tracks the predicted sentiment as recorded by polls, giving validity to the metric as a general barometer of public opinion. The green line (Jan. 6) indicates the capitol riots, and marks the 3-day lowest sustained negative public opinion during the queried timespan. The yellow line (Jan. 20) marks Trump's concession speech, in which he committed to peacefully transferring power, and is the absolute maximimum for public sentiment.

## A Special Note on Peer Evaluations

Thank you again to Michael Cornell for the great discussions we had during the peer evaluation process. I would specifically like to thank him for several of the suggestions he gave on my final analysis. I have introduced a more complete causal analysis surrounding the Jan. 6 capitol riots, with greater validity, thanks to his comments. I have also been able to run my analysis on much larger data due to his suggestion to use a virtual machine. Finally, I have reworked many of my figures and graphs to be more simplistic and coherent.
